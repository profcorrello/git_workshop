# Project Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the **Task Manager Web Application**, a simple web-based tool for managing tasks and to-do lists.

## Functional Requirements

### User Authentication
- Users must be able to sign up and log in using an email and password.
- Passwords should be securely hashed.
- Users should be able to reset their password via email.

### Task Management
- Users can create, edit, and delete tasks.
- Tasks must have a title, description, due date, and status (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed).
- Users can set task priorities (Low, Medium, High).

### User Interface
- The application should have a responsive design accessible from desktop and mobile devices.
- A dashboard should display upcoming and overdue tasks.
- Users can filter and search tasks by status, priority, and due date.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- The application should load within 2 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
- The backend should handle at least 100 concurrent users without degradation.

### Security
- All user data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- The application should implement role-based access control for administrative features.

### Scalability
- The system should be designed to support future feature expansions.
- The database should efficiently handle increasing numbers of users and tasks.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## Deployment
- The application will be hosted on AWS using an EC2 instance.
- CI/CD pipelines will be configured for automated testing and deployment.

## Version Control Guidelines
- Use feature branches for new functionality (`feature/task-crud`).
- Follow conventional commit messages (`feat: add task creation endpoint`).
- Code reviews are required before merging to `main` branch.
